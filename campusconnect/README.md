## 🔄 Authentication Flow

1. **Login**: User enters credentials
2. **Validation**: Check against mock user database
3. **Role Detection**: Identify user role (admin/student/club_leader)
4. **Dashboard Routing**: Redirect to appropriate dashboard
5. **Session Persistence**: Store user state in localStorage
6. **Route Protection**: Verify access on route changes

## 🎯 Next Phase Preparations

The current implementation provides a solid foundation for:
- **Phase 2**: Event Management System
- **Phase 3**: Geo-Verified Attendance
- **Phase 4**: Point System & Profiles
- **Phase 5**: AI Features & Analytics
- **Phase 6**: Admin Controls & Polish

## 🔧 Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

## 🎨 Design Highlights

- **Color System**: Blue primary with role-specific accent colors
- **Typography**: Clean, readable fonts with proper hierarchy
- **Layout**: Consistent navigation and content structure
- **Interactions**: Smooth transitions and hover effects
- **Accessibility**: Proper contrast ratios and keyboard navigation

## 🔗 Database Schema Integration

The frontend is now **fully aligned** with the backend database schema:

### **Schema Structure:**
```sql
Students: sid (PK), name, usn (Unique), branch, email (Unique), password, total_points
Admin: aid (PK), name, email (Unique), password  
Clubs: cid (PK), cname, club_head_sid (FK), aid (FK)
Events: eid (PK), ename, duration, points, cid (FK)
ActivityPoints: apid (PK), sid (FK), eid (FK), cid (FK), point_count
Attendance: attid (PK), sid (FK), eid (FK), status, timestamp
```

### **Frontend Alignment:**
- ✅ **AuthContext** uses exact database field names
- ✅ **Mock data** matches schema structure
- ✅ **API service layer** ready for backend integration
- ✅ **Profile management** shows correct fields
- ✅ **Dashboard components** use schema-compliant data

### **API Integration Ready:**
The `src/services/api.js` file contains all endpoint structures matching your backend:
- Authentication endpoints
- CRUD operations for all entities
- Relationship-based queries
- QR code and location services

### **Environment Configuration:**
Copy `env.example` to `.env` and update the `REACT_APP_API_URL` to match your backend server.

## 🔮 Ready for Backend Integration

The frontend is now **100% compatible** with your database schema and ready for immediate integration:
- All data handling uses exact database field names
- API service layer matches expected backend endpoints
- Authentication flow supports email-based login
- Role-based access uses proper foreign key relationships
